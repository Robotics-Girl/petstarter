      <h2>Gumnut</h2>
      <p>
        Gumnut gets her name from the first thing she tried to eat when she came into the centre.
        She will eat anything, including the socks from the clothesline, so keep them hanging high!

      <h2>Puddles</h2>
      <p>
        Puddles was found at the edge of a creek, and came to us a little bedraggled.
        She's a baby goose with snails on her mind, and is quite happy to snuggle on a lap when she's sleepy!
